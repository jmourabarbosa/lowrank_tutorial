# Introduction to lowrank tutorial
Two-day tutorial on low rank RNNs theory and reverse engineering trained networks. 

The first tutorial is heavily based on the paper and code provided in [(Mastrogiuseppe & Ostojic, 2019)](https://github.com/fmastrogiuseppe/LowRank). For more advance concepts, please refer to that paper.

The second tutorial heavily based on the paper and code provided in [(Dubreuil, Valente et al, 2022)](https://github.com/adrian-valente/populations_paper_code/). All the code inside "low_rank_rnns" was taken from that repository.
