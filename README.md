# Introduction to low-rank RNN tutorial
Two-day tutorial on low rank RNNs theory and reverse engineering trained networks, updated from https://github.com/jmourabarbosa/lowrank_tutorial.

The first tutorial is  based on the paper and code provided in [(Mastrogiuseppe & Ostojic, 2019)](https://github.com/fmastrogiuseppe/LowRank) and [(Dubreuil, Valente et al, 2022)](https://github.com/adrian-valente/populations_paper_code/). 

The second tutorial heavily based on the paper and code provided in [(Dubreuil, Valente et al, 2022)](https://github.com/adrian-valente/populations_paper_code/). All the code inside "low_rank_rnns" was taken from that repository.
